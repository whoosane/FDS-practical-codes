Problem Statment:
a) Write a Python program to store roll numbers of students in array who attended training program in
random order.
Write function for searching whether particular student attended training program or not, using Linear and
Sentinal Search.
b) Write a python program to store roll numbers of students in array who attended training program in
sorted order.
Write function for searching whether particular student attended training program or not, using Binary and
Fibonacci Search
