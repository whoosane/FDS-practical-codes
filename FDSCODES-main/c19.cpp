Problem Statement
Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named
'pinnacle club’. Students of second, third and final year of department can be granted
membership on request. Similarly on may cancel the membership of club .First node is
reserved for the president of the club and last node is reserved for the secretary of club .write
C++ program to maintain club members information using singly linked list .store student PRN
and Name .Write function to:
a) Add and Delete the members as well as the president or even secretary.
b) Compute total numbers of members of club.
c) Display members.z
d) Display list in reverse order using recursion.zz
e) Two linked lists exizzsts for two divisions .Concatenate two lists.
