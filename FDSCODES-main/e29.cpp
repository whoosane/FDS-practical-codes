Problem Statement
Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and
a typical example is the creation of a job queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not use
priorities, then the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system. Write C++ program for simulating job
queue. Write functions to add job and delete job from queue.
