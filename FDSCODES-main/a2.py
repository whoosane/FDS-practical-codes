Problem Statment:
Write a Python program to store marks scored in the subject "Fundamental of # Data Structure" by   N students in the class. Write functions to compute the  following: 
 a) The average score of the class 
 b) Highest score and lowest score of the class 
 c) Count of students who were absent for the test 
 d) Display mark with the highest frequency
